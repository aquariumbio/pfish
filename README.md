# pFish (aka Parrotfish, aka Phoenixfish)

Scripts for pulling/pushing operation type and library code to/from Aquarium and for running tests.

## Getting started

> Previous versions of these instructions had you clone this repository, which is no longer necessary.

Make sure you have Docker installed.

Download the pfish script with the command

  ```bash
  wget -vO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquariumbio/pfish/master/pfish-install.sh | sh
  ```

This script will download the pfish wrapper script and install it in `~/bin`.
So, once the script is done, you'll need to [add `~/bin` to your PATH](https://opensource.com/article/17/6/set-path-linux). 

If you don't have `wget` installed, you can clone this repository and run `make install`.

## Updating

Pfish doesn't currently track updates itself.

Pfish has two parts: the wrapper script, and the pfish Docker image.

1. Update the wrapper script by running the install script mentioned above.
2. Update the pfish image by running

   ```bash
   pfish update
   ```

*Note*: The image is updated more frequently than the wrapper script.

## Configuring

Initially, pfish is configured to connect to a [local Aquarium instance](https://aquariumbio.github.io/aquarium-local/) using the default user login (`neptune`) and password (`aquarium`) at URL (`http://localhost/`).
If that is the instance and login that you are using you don't need to do anything else to start with.

To use a different login with the local instance, run the command

```bash
pfish configure add -l <user-login> -p <user-password>
```

with the new login name and password. The name of this configuration will be automatically set to "local".

To add another login configuration, use the command

```bash
pfish configure add -n <configuration-name> -l <user-login> -p <user-password> -u <instance-url>
```

where you specify the configuration-name, user-login, password and instance URL.
A configuration name is simply a key to keep track of the login information for a particular Aquarium instance.

*Note*: Using the `configure add` command without providing a new name will overwrite the existing local login configuration.

The most common use of `configure add` is to set up login configurations for different Aquarium instances.
For instance, a user might have a `production` configuration in addition to the `local` configuration.
In this case, the `local` configuration is still used by default, but the `production` configuration can be specified when transferring operation types.

To change the default configuration, use the command

```bash
pfish configure set-default -n <config-name>
```

with the name of the login configuration that you want to be the default.

To list all your saved configurations, use the command:

```bash
pfish configure show
```

## Commands

All commands other than `configure`  use the current working directory by default along with the Aquarium instance in the default login configuration.
These defaults can be overridden with the following options

- `-d <directory-name>` - use the named subdirectory of the current working directory.
- `-n <config-name>` - use the named login configuration instead of the default.
# TODO: Check whether this is accurate

### Pull

The available pull commands are:

*Note*: If you do not specify a directory name, files will be pulled into your current working directory.

1. Pull all libraries and operation types in an Aquarium instance. 

   ```bash
   pfish pull -d <directory_name>
   ```

2. Pull all operation types and libraries from a category

   ```bash
   pfish pull -c <category_name>
   ```

3. Pull a single operation type

   ```bash
   pfish pull -c <category_name> -o <operation_type_name>
   ```

4. Pull a single library

   ```bash
   pfish pull -c <category_name> -l <library_name>

```
### Push

The available push commands are:

1. Push all operation types and libraries in a directory:

   ```bash
   pfish push -d <directory_name>
   ```

2. Push all operation types and libraries in a category:

   ```bash
   pfish push -c <category_name>
   ```

3. Push a single library:

   ```bash
   pfish push -c <category_name> -l <library_name>
   ```

3. Push a single operation type

   ```bash
   pfish push -c <category_name> -o <operation_type_name>
   ```

_Note_: If an operation type or library does not already exist in your instance of Aquarium, pushing will create it if your fi
les are in the correct format, examples of which are in the TK section:

If you want to create an entirely new operation type or library, we suggest you use the `create` command to set up the necessar
y file structure.

### Create

The available create commands are:

1. Create an operation type

   ```bash
   pfish create -c <category-name> -o <operation-type-name>
   ```

2. Create a library

   ```bash
   pfish create -c <category-name> -l <library-name>
   ```

### Test

The available test commands are: 

1. Test an Operation Type

   ```bash
   pfish test -c <category_name> -o <operation_type_name>
   ```

2. Test all Operation Types in a Category 

   ```bash
   pfish test -c <category_name>
   ```

3. Test all Operation Types in a Directory

   ```bash
   pfish test 
   ```

4. Test Libraries: Not yet implemented

## Developing Operation Types and Libraries

The strategy for working with operation types and libraries with pfish and git is to create a git repo and then use pfish from within the directory for the repository.

The first step is to create a git repository.
So, assuming you first initialize a `myaquarium` repo on GitHub, the commands would be

```bash
git clone <github-path-for-myaquarium>
cd myaquarium
```

You can then either create new operation types and libraries, or pull existing ones from your Aquarium instance.

To create a new operation type, use the `create` command

```bash
pfish create -c MyCategory -o MyOperationType
```

which will create the operation type both in Aquarium and in the current directory.
The local files will be in the directory `mycategory`:

If `mycategory` exists in Aquarium, the new operation type will be saved within it. If it does not exist, it will be created.
```bash
.
`-- mycategory
    `-- operation_types
        `-- myoperationtype
            |-- cost_model.rb
            |-- definition.json
            |-- documentation.rb
            |-- precondition.rb
            `-- protocol.rb
```
or, for a library

```bash
.
`-- mycategory
    `-- libraries
        `-- mylibrary
            |-- definition.json
            `-- source.rb
```

 
Once the operation type or library is created, make an initial git commit of the new files with the commands

```bash
git add mycategory/operation_types/myoperationtype or git add mycategory/libraries/mylibrary
git commit -m "Add new definition for MyOperationType"
```

and then you can edit the files.

> Notice that pfish uses filenames that are the Aquarium names changed to all lowercase, and spaces changed to underscores.
> The original names are captured in the `definition.json` file and used when operation types and libraries are pushed.

TODO: I'm not sure what this statement means?
> You do need to use the Aquarium names for libraries in your protocol or library code.

To edit operation types or libraries that already exist in Aquarium, use the pull command and add the files to the repository.
For example, consider a `Cloning` category with the following structure

- Libraries:
  - Stripwell Methods
  - Gradient PCR
- Operation Types:
  - Run Gel
  - Order Primer

You can pull this category by running

```bash
pfish pull -c Cloning
```

which will create the following directory structure

```bash
cloning
|-- libraries
|   |-- stripwell_methods
|   `-- gradient_pcr
`-- operation_types
    |-- run_gel
    `-- order_primer
```

with each subdirectory containing the code for the components of each library or operation type.
To add this code to the repository add the `cloning` directory and commit using git.

When you change files you can push the changes to Aquarium with the `push` command.
For instance, if you changed the `Run Gel` operation type, you would run the command

```bash
pfish push -c Cloning -o "Run Gel"
```

to push only that operation type.

If you change files in different operation types, you can push the whole category at once by running 

```
pfish push -c Cloning
```

## Developing Pfish

## VS Code Dev Container

This repository is set up with a VS Code devcontainer.
To use it make sure that you have the VS Code Remote extension installed and use it to open the repository in the container.

> If you change the `requirements.txt` file, you will need to rebuild the devcontainer.

This container uses the Dockerfile in the `.devcontainer` directory, which is configured with development tools â€“ unlike the pfish Dockerfile.
To allow the pyfish.py script to be run, the devcontainer minimally mounts the `config` directory and installs the packages using the `requirements.txt` file.

## Writing/Running tests

The repo is setup to run tests from within the Dev Container.
Start the container in VS Code, and run `pytest` from the command line.
The test files are in `test/pxfish`.

When writing tests for functions that write to disk, make sure that you are using the `tmpdir` fixture to manage the working directory.

## GitHub CI

The GitHub repository is configured to run a CI workflow that publishes a Docker image to aquariumbio/pfish. 
See the files in the `.github` directory for details.

## Local build

A Makefile is provided to replicate the installation process locally, but is not needed for development.
Use `make build` to create the pfish Docker image locally, and you can then run a shell within the container by typing

```bash
docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/bash aquariumbio/pfish
```

## Manual push

If there are cases where you want to ensure that the new image is pushed to Docker Hub, do the following:

1. Make sure the version number is what you want it to be
2. Run `make build`
3. Run `docker push aquariumbio/pfish:$VERSION`
